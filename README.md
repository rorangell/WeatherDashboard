# Weather Dashboard

UCF coding bootcamp task.
Languages used: HTML, Javascript and CSS.

Tha idea of the app is see the weather outlook for multiple cities.
When you type a city name you will be able to see the five day forecast.
It starts showing the weather for Rio. Other cities will be added as you type.
I used moment.js and bootstraps libraries.
